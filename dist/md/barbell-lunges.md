 - Take a step forward (2-3 feet) keeping your abs drawn in and your upper body straight.
 - Slowly lower one knee down as if kneeling while keeping your other knee bent at a 90 degree angle, do not let your knee touch the ground.
 - Lower your body so that your rear knee is just above the floor and hold for a moment before returning to the starting position.
 - Repeat on other side.

## Tips


 - Your front knee should never go past the toes of that foot and should remain at a 90 degree angle in order, to prevent knee injury.
