 - Lie one side of your torso, and with your waist and hip against a Stability Ball, position your feet on the floor (or against a wall) for support.
 - With one hand, hold a weight against the side of your head.
 - Place your free hand across your chest to steady yourself.
 - Raise your torso up off the ball by flexing your waist.
 - With controlled movements lower yourself back onto the ball.
