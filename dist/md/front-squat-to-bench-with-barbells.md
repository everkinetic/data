## Steps


 - The Front Squat works the same muscles as the rear squat without placing the weight of the bar on your shoulders. This exercise can be a good substitute for people with back and neck injuries. By using a bench you remind yourself how far to squat down
 - Steps
 - Place a bench behind you.
 - Place the barbell on your upper chest, resting it across your front deltoids and holding it with your arms crossed securely.
 - Keep your head and back straight, abs drawn in and your toes pointing slightly outward.
 - Slowly “squat” down so your upper thighs are parallel to the floor.
 - Slowly return to the starting position.
 - Note: Practice the squat without any weight to allow yourself to become comfortable with the movements. Do not sit on the bench during the exercise.
