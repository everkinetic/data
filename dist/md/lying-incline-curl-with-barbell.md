 - Adjust an incline bench to a 45 degree angle.
 - Grasp a barbell with a shoulder width grip and lean face down against the bench, with your feet resting on the floor for support.
 - Allow your arms to hang down at your sides.
 - Keeping your elbows straight, raise the bar up towards your head, contracting your biceps.
 - In a controlled manner lower the weight and repeat.
 - Note: Practice steady movements in this exercise, be careful not to let your arms sway.
