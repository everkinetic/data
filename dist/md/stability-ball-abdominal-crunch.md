## Steps


 - This crunch uses a Stability Ball. The ball allows you a better range of movement because it adapts better to your spine.
 - Sit on top of an exercise or stability ball with your feet placed firmly on the floor for support.
 - Position yourself so that your lower back is centered on the middle of the ball.
 - Lie back and bring your hands across your chest, or on either side of your head (over your ears).
 - Raise your head, chest and shoulders up crunching your abs as you sit upright.
 - Pause for a moment and then lower yourself to the starting position.
 - Note: For best results, use a full range of motion in this exercise.
