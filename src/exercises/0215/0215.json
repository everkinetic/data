        "Grasp a barbell with a shoulder width grip and lean face down against the bench, with your feet resting on the floor for support.",
        "Allow your arms to hang down at your sides.",
        "Keeping your elbows straight, raise the bar up towards your head, contracting your biceps.",

        "Note: Practice steady movements in this exercise, be careful not to let your arms sway."
